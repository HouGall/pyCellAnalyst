## Welcome ##

pyCellAnalyst is free, open-source software aimed at reconstructing biological objects from 3D image data under different mechanical conditions, and then calculating the deformation between those conditions. Its initial application was for data obtained from multi-photon laser scanning microscopy of chondrocytes within articular cartilage. That said, the software may be applied to many other data types. Currently, the supported input formats of 3D image are either a sequence of TIFF or [NifTi][1]; however, the extension to other formats should be straightforward and can be implemented upon request.
